# Semantic-image-segmentation-with-U-Net
we built a U-Net model from scratch to output segmentation masks that shows which pixels of an input
image are part of the background, foreground, and outline. we built the U-Net by chaining the encoder,
bottleneck, and decoder. we have trained the our U-net model on the Oxford Pets - IIT dataset dataset. This
contains pet images, their classes, segmentation masks
